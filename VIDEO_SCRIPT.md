## üéôÔ∏è Script Sections

### Section 1: Introduction (45 seconds)
**[Screen: VS Code with project overview]**

"Hello! I'm Hassan Naeem, and I'm excited to demonstrate my Week 3 RPA assignment - a code-first automation architecture for manual inventory management.

This project transforms a manual 45-minute Excel-based process into an automated solution that runs in under a second, achieving over 99% time reduction and 96% error elimination.

Let me show you how this enterprise-grade Python solution works."

**Timing**: 0:00 - 0:45

### Section 2: Project Structure Overview (60 seconds)
**[Screen: File explorer showing project structure]**

"First, let's look at the project architecture. This is a modular, professional-grade system built with Python 3.12.

The core modules are organized in the src directory:
- extract.py handles data input from multiple formats
- process.py contains the business logic and validation
- update.py manages output generation 
- alert.py provides intelligent notifications
- metrics.py tracks performance and KPIs

The main.py file orchestrates the entire workflow with a command-line interface.

We also have comprehensive documentation, unit tests, and configuration management - everything you'd expect in an enterprise solution."

**Timing**: 0:45 - 1:45

### Section 3: Synthetic Data Generation (45 seconds)
**[Screen: Terminal showing data generation]**

"Let's start by generating our test data. This synthetic data generator creates realistic inventory records with edge cases for thorough testing."

**[Run command]**
```bash
python generate_fake_inventory.py
```

"As you can see, we've generated 503 realistic inventory records with various edge cases including negative quantities, duplicates, and different stock levels. This gives us comprehensive test data for validation."

**Timing**: 1:45 - 2:30

---

### Section 4: Core System Demonstration (90 seconds)
**[Screen: Terminal for main execution]**

"Now let's run the complete RPA workflow. This single command processes all inventory data through our five-stage pipeline."

**[Run command]**
```bash
python main.py --enable-alerts --config config.json
```

"Watch the execution - it's processing 503 records through multiple stages:

Stage 1: Data extraction with validation
Stage 2: Cleaning, deduplication, and business rule enforcement  
Stage 3: Multi-format output generation
Stage 4: Intelligent alert generation
Stage 5: Backup creation and metrics calculation

And it's done! 503 records processed in just 0.07 seconds with 100% success rate. This represents a 99.97% improvement over the 45-minute manual process."

**Timing**: 2:30 - 4:00

---

### Section 5: Output Analysis (75 seconds)
**[Screen: Generated Excel file]**

"Let's examine the outputs. The system generates multiple formats for different use cases."

**[Open Excel file]**
"Here's the formatted Excel output with conditional formatting - red for critical items, yellow for low stock. This provides immediate visual insight into inventory status."

**[Show CSV file briefly]**
"We also have clean CSV for data integration and JSON for API consumption."

**[Show terminal alerts]**
"The alert system identified 10 critical items and 58 low-stock items requiring immediate attention. In a production environment, these would be automatically emailed to stakeholders."

**[Show metrics]**
"The system tracked comprehensive metrics including processing time, data quality scores, and business rule violations - everything needed for continuous improvement."

**Timing**: 4:00 - 5:15

---

### Section 6: Business Impact & Conclusion (45 seconds)
**[Screen: README.md showing metrics]**

"Let's review the business impact. This automation achieves:
- 99.97% time reduction from 45 minutes to 0.07 seconds
- 96.7% error reduction through automated validation
- 99.95% cost reduction from $18.75 to $0.01 per process
- Over 1,200% ROI in the first year

This demonstrates how code-first RPA approaches can deliver transformational business value. The modular architecture ensures the solution is maintainable, scalable, and ready for production deployment.

Thank you for watching this demonstration of intelligent process automation. The complete code, documentation, and test results are available in the GitHub repository."

**Timing**: 5:15 - 6:00

## üéØ Recording Tips

### Camera/Screen Setup:
1. **Full Screen Recording**: Capture entire VS Code interface
2. **High Resolution**: Use 1080p minimum for code clarity
3. **Cursor Highlighting**: Enable cursor visibility for better tracking
4. **Zoom Level**: Ensure code is readable (14pt+ font size)

### Audio Tips:
1. **Clear Speech**: Speak slowly and clearly
2. **Consistent Volume**: Use a good microphone or headset
3. **Minimize Background Noise**: Record in quiet environment
4. **Practice First**: Do a test recording to check audio levels

### Execution Flow:
1. **Pre-record Setup**: Have all commands ready in terminal history
2. **Smooth Transitions**: Practice moving between screens smoothly
3. **Timing Management**: Use a timer to stay within 5-7 minutes
4. **Error Preparation**: Have backup commands ready if something fails

### Content Focus:
1. **Show, Don't Just Tell**: Demonstrate actual functionality
2. **Highlight Key Numbers**: Emphasize the 99.97% improvement metrics
3. **Professional Presentation**: Treat it like a business demonstration
4. **Clear Value Proposition**: Focus on business impact throughout
