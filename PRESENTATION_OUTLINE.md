### Slide 2: Problem Statement & Business Case
**Title**: The Challenge: Manual Inventory Management

**Content**:
- **Current State**: Manual Excel-based inventory processing
  - ⏱️ 45 minutes per processing cycle
  - ❌ 15% error rate due to manual data entry
  - 💰 $18.75 cost per process
  - 📊 Limited visibility and reporting
  
- **Business Impact**: 
  - Daily productivity loss
  - High error rates affecting customer satisfaction
  - No real-time alerting for critical stock levels
  - Scalability limitations

**Speaker Notes**:
- Manual inventory management is a common pain point in many organizations
- The combination of time consumption, errors, and lack of visibility creates significant business risk
- Our automation solution addresses all these challenges while providing measurable improvements
- This represents a typical scenario where RPA can deliver immediate value
