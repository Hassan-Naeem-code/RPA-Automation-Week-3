# GitHub Pages Setup - UPDATED SOLUTION

## ‚úÖ Current Status
Your documentation is already live at: **https://hassan-naeem-code.github.io/RPA-Automation-Week-3/**

## üîß GitHub Actions Environment Fix Applied

The workflow has been updated to include the required `environment` configuration:

```yaml
environment:
  name: github-pages
  url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
```

## üìã Repository Settings (Required for Automation)

To enable automated deployments via GitHub Actions:

### Step 1: Configure GitHub Pages Source
1. Go to: https://github.com/Hassan-Naeem-code/RPA-Automation-Week-3/settings/pages
2. Under **"Source"**, select **"GitHub Actions"** (not "Deploy from a branch")
3. Click **"Save"**

### Step 2: Enable Actions Permissions  
1. Go to: https://github.com/Hassan-Naeem-code/RPA-Automation-Week-3/settings/actions
2. Under **"Workflow permissions"**, select:
   - ‚úÖ **"Read and write permissions"**
   - ‚úÖ **"Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"**
3. Click **"Save"**

## üöÄ Deployment Methods Available

### Method 1: Automatic (GitHub Actions)
- Triggers on every push to `master` branch
- Uses the updated workflows with proper environment configuration
- Three workflow files available: `ci.yml`, `deploy-docs.yml`, `pages.yml`

### Method 2: Manual Local Deployment
```bash
# From your local repository (already working)
mkdocs gh-deploy --force
```

### Method 3: Manual Workflow Trigger
1. Go to: https://github.com/Hassan-Naeem-code/RPA-Automation-Week-3/actions
2. Select any of the documentation workflows
3. Click **"Run workflow"**

## ‚úÖ What Was Fixed
- **Added `environment` configuration** to deployment jobs
- **Separated build and deploy jobs** for better reliability  
- **Added proper concurrency controls** to prevent conflicts
- **Enhanced permissions** for Pages deployment
- **Multiple workflow options** for maximum compatibility

## üéØ Next Steps
1. Complete the repository settings configuration above
2. Push any changes to trigger automatic deployment
3. Your documentation will auto-update on every commit to master

## üîç Verification
The site is live and working. The GitHub Actions workflows are now properly configured for automated deployments once you complete the repository settings.
