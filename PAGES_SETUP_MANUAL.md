# Manual GitHub Pages Setup Guide

## Quick Fix: Enable GitHub Pages in Repository Settings

Since the automated enablement failed, please follow these manual steps:

### Step 1: Enable GitHub Pages (Required)
1. Go to: https://github.com/Hassan-Naeem-code/RPA-Automation-Week-3/settings/pages
2. Under **"Source"**, select **"GitHub Actions"** (not "Deploy from a branch")
3. Click **"Save"**

### Step 2: Configure Actions Permissions
1. Go to: https://github.com/Hassan-Naeem-code/RPA-Automation-Week-3/settings/actions
2. Under **"Workflow permissions"**, select:
   - ✅ **"Read and write permissions"**
   - ✅ **"Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"**
3. Click **"Save"**

### Step 3: Trigger Deployment
After completing steps 1-2, you have three options:

#### Option A: Push new commit (automatic)
The workflow will run automatically on the next push to master.

#### Option B: Manual workflow trigger
1. Go to: https://github.com/Hassan-Naeem-code/RPA-Automation-Week-3/actions
2. Click on **"Deploy Documentation (Alternative)"** workflow
3. Click **"Run workflow"** → **"Run workflow"**

#### Option C: Use MkDocs built-in deployment
```bash
# From your local repository
mkdocs gh-deploy --force
```

## Alternative: Simple HTML Deployment

If GitHub Pages still doesn't work, you can create a simple HTML version:

1. Build the docs locally: `mkdocs build`
2. The `site/` folder contains your documentation
3. You can host this anywhere (Netlify, Vercel, etc.)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
- **Repository must be public** for free GitHub Pages
- **Actions must be enabled** in repository settings
- **Workflow permissions** must allow write access

### Verification:
After setup, your documentation will be available at:
**https://hassan-naeem-code.github.io/RPA-Automation-Week-3/**

### Still Having Issues?
Try the alternative deployment workflow which uses a different method that's more compatible with various repository configurations.
